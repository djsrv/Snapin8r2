## Old README

https://djdolphin.github.io/Snapin8r2/

Snapin8r2 converts [Scratch 2.0](https://scratch.mit.edu/) projects to [Snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu/) projects. Snapin8r2 is based on [Snapin8r](http://hardmath123.github.io/Snapin8r/) by [Hardmath123](http://hardmath123.github.io/). It uses [JSZip](http://stuk.github.io/jszip/) to read <code>.sb2</code> files and contains SVG-handling code from [phosphorus](http://phosphorus.github.io/) by [Nathan Dinsmore](https://github.com/nathan).
